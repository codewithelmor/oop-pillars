# Pillars of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

The four main pillars of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) are:

1. **`Encapsulation`**: Encapsulation is the concept of bundling data (attributes) and the methods (functions) that operate on that data into a single unit called a class. It allows you to control access to the data and hide the internal details of how an object works.

2. **`Inheritance`**: Inheritance is a mechanism that allows a new class (subclass or derived class) to inherit properties and behaviors from an existing class (base class or parent class). It promotes code reusability and hierarchy in your code.

3. **`Polymorphism`**: Polymorphism is the ability of different objects to respond to the same method or message in a way that is specific to their individual class. This allows you to write more generic and flexible code.

4. **`Abstraction`**: Abstraction is the process of simplifying complex reality by modeling classes based on the essential properties and behaviors an object should have, while hiding unnecessary details. It helps in managing complexity and understanding the system at a higher level.

These pillars are fundamental to OOP and are used to create well-structured, modular, and maintainable code.
